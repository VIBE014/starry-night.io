                <p>Dear Abby,</p>
                
                <p>As this year comes to an end and a new one begins, I've found myself thinking about you more than I expected—and smiling every time I do.</p>
                
                <p>Getting to know you has been one of the most unexpected and meaningful parts of my life lately. There's something about the way you talk, the way you see things, and the way you make moments feel lighter just by being there. Somewhere along the line, my admiration turned into something deeper, and I realized I'm starting to fall for you.</p>
                
                <p>I don't want to rush or pretend to have everything figured out. I just know that what I feel is real, and it's something I'd like to grow—slowly, honestly, and with intention. As we step into a new year, I can't think of anyone I'd rather choose than you.</p>
                
                <p>So this is me, being brave and honest: <span class="highlight">Abby, would you be my girlfriend</span> and start this new year with me—not just as a moment, but as something we build together?</p>
                
                <p>No matter your answer, I'm grateful for you and for what you've already brought into my life. But I hope this year begins with us choosing each other.</p>
                
                <p class="new-year">Happy New Year <span class="heart">🤍</span></p>
